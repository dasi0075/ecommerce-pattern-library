  <h1 class="text-center">Why does Nadia<br>deserve this grade?</h1>
  <p>I believe I gave my all despite of the circumstances and hardships. I went as far as I could understand with time given, specially after the lockdown. There is still some things I did not quite understand but I am proud of how far I have come with this site.</p>
  <p>My biggest struggle was to understand how to stylize individual buttons using the pattern library as well as my forms, and also how to select different shirts for my homepage without using the loop (I wanted only 3 different ones in my homepage). This is something I need to improve for next semester.</p>
  <p>Below is he rubric for this assignment. I think I would give myself a C or B-</p>
